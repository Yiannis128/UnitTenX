02/07/2025:

- Added support for abstract data types, i.e. when several functions used to 
  access a global resource.
- Created one more LLM interaction to assist generating a partially correct 
  extern "C" interface.
- Enhanced DB to add information on name modification (to avoid clashing of
  names in static functions).
- Fixed bug on #define's when internal names clash with variable names that
  we are changing (for example, static int u; #define A(u) u+1 would trigger
  the bug, as we want to change the first "u", but not the second and third
  ones.
- Added rate control to enable Anthropic to run.
- Added timeout with retries in case we lose the connection.

01/17/2025:

- Support from Anthropic and OpenAI with new prompts.
- Move "core dump" handling from reflection to get_coverage_cc.py because when a core dump
  happens, we do not have any other message other than that it crashed. This was making the
  loop in the reflection too long to solve with countless calls to slow LLMs.
- Fixed bug that when we do not pass -I, but put every include in --cflags, it is propagated
  to -I.
- We extract the function interface and include files for extern "C" { ... } in the test
  function. If one of the parameters were an user defined type, it making the LLM confused.

12/14/2024:

- Initial offical release.
